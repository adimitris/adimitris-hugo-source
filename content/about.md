__I believe that__ the best way to truly learn a skill, a process or an idea is to build something that demonstrates it. I'm trying to find a good reason why I am so passionate to spend so much of my free time programming and working with computers and electronic circuits. I really cannot find a definite answer to this question. I believe that my interest in computer engineering arises from my tendency to explore thought and learning: by combining computer hardware and software, an engineer can manufacture and program an intelligent machine that replicates part of their thinking. During the process of creating such a machine, one must break down the knowledge he or she wants to replicate in its most fundamental parts and create an algorithm that demonstrates these parts. I find this challenge very fascinating and I love to undertake tasks that involve computers.

__My name is__ Dimitris and I'm a 3rd year engineering student at Cambridge University. I spend my free time dancing Rock n Roll, discussing politics, travelling and tinkering.
