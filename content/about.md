__I believe that__ the best way to truly learn a skill, a process or an idea is to build something that demonstrates it. My interest in computer engineering arises from my tendency to explore thought and learning: by combining computer hardware and software, an engineer can manufacture and program an intelligent machine that replicates part of their thinking. During the process of creating such a machine, one must break down the knowledge they want to replicate in its most fundamental parts and create an algorithm that demonstrates these parts. I find this challenge fascinating.
