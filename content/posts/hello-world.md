__I recently came across__ [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) the other day while reading this [article](https://deltahacker.gr/text/hugo-static-site/) of my dear friends at [deltahacker.gr](https://deltahacker.gr). Thought it'd be a cool little project to make a personal website using Hugo in order to get to know the glory of static website generators and tick "Make a personal website" off my weekly checklist.

It's been a fun experience and a nice break from revising Linear Algebra.. Next task is to find out why the site's favicon won't appear on Chrome browsers and maybe brainstorm ways I can make use of this place.
